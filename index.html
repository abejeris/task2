                    <p>Newton was an
                        English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist, theologian and one of the most
                        influential
                        men in human history. His Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to
                        be the most
                        influential book in the history of science.</p>

                        Einstein received
                        the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery
